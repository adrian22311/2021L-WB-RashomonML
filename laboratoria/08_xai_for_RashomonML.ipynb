    "-  When the empirical Rashomon set is large, it is reasonable to assume that models with various desirable properties can exist inside it. For example, sparser, more transparent models, models that obey domain-specific constraints such as monotonicity along a given set of features, models that obey fairness constraints, and models that rely more on features that we can trust—these models may all live within the same large Rashomon set. \n",

    "- Additionally, even if the candidate models do not contain the true data generating process, we may hope that some of these models function in similar ways to the data generating process. In particular, we may hope there exist well performing candidate models that place the same importance on a variable of interest as the underlying data generating process does."
